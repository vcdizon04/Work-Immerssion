      With the passage of the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 or Republic Act 10533, Deped was tasked to implement the K to 12 Program essentially adding two (2) years of specialization          within the Basic Educational System; 
        DepEd designed the implementation of RA 10533 within the framework of increased community involvement in the learner's experience;
         With this premise, DepEd offers venues for various stakelholders to participate in the implementation of RA 10533 and, the same offer, accepted by the PARTIES herein; 
        The Work Immersion Program is one of the course requirements for graduation. A SHS student has to undergo Work Immersion in a business organization or establishment with work requirements related to the specialization. Through Work Immersion, the students are exposed to and are familiarized with the work-related environment related to their field of specialization. Specifically, the students are able to:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Appreciate the importance and application of the principles and theories learned in school.</li>
      <li>Enhance their technical knowledge and skills.</li>
      <li>Enrich their skills in communications and human relations.</li>
      <li>Develop good work habits, attitudes, appreciation, and respect for work.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Objectives Work immersion will help develop among the learners life and career skills, and will prepare them to make decisions on postsecondary education or employment Through partnership building, DepEd hopes that the Partner Institutions will provide learners with work immersion opportunities, workplace or hands on experience, and additional learning resources. It aims to make the learners: 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Appreciate the importance and application of the principles and theories learned in school;</li>
      <li>Enhance their technical knowledge and skills;</li>
      <li>Enrich their skills in communications and human relations; and</li>
      <li>Develop good work habits, attitudes, appreciation and respect for work.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      By the time learners reach Senior High School, they would have already acquired almost all the competencies and skills that would prepare them for the curriculum exits (highe education, employment, middle-skills development, entrepreneurship). Work immersion provides them with an avenue to test themselves and apply what they have learned in a non-school scenario. In work learners are not only able to apply their previous training but are also able to experience the social interactions in a work environment. Their experiences during work i nmersion will develop many skills and values that would help them as they transition from high school to real life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To assure the achievement of the above objectives of Work Immersion, this policy serves to guide schools in: 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Creating flexible work immersion arrangements for their learners.</li>
      <li>Providing options for work immersion that are relevant to learners' purposes and needs;</li>
      <li>Organizing work immersion opportunities for learners that are consistent with the diverse human resource requirements of partner institutions for work immersion; and</li>
      <li>Articulating the scope and limits of work immersion in the context of basic education whe building relationships with work immersion partners.</li>
    </ol>
