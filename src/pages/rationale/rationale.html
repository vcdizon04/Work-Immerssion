      One of the goals of the K to 12 Basic Education Program is to develop in learners the competencies, work ethic, and values relevant to pursuing further education and/or joining the world of work. To achieve greater congruence between basic education and the nationâ€™s development targets, Work Immersion, a required subject (See attached curriculum guide in Annex A), has been incorporated into the curriculum. This subject will provide learners with opportunities:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>to become familiar with the work place;</li>
      <li>for employment simulation; and</li>
      <li>to apply their competencies in areas of specialization/applied subjects in authentic work environments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To achieve the above objectives, Work Immersion is thus a requirement for graduation from secondary education. Learners are immersed in actual work environments such as workshops offices and laboratories in which their prior training is relevant. Other possible venues for work immersion are listed in Annex B.</p>
  <p>These guidelines were formulated based on the rich experiences of modeling schools, tech-voc schools, partnership focal persons, industry partners, and youth development advocates. These guidelines can provide process support to field offices of the Department of Education (DepEd) in fostering relationships and strengthening partnerships so that learners will have access to suitable work immersion venues and other related resources.</p>
  <h4>Scope</h4>
  <p>These guidelines shall apply to all Senior High School learners in the following institutions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DepEd Senior High Schools</li>
    <li>Private Senior High Schools</li>
    <li>Senior High Schools run by state colleges and universities, and local universities and colleges</li>
    <li>Technical-Vocational Institutions</li>
  </ul>
